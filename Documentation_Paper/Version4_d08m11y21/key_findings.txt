Dataset creation

1) Speed stimuli (sub, supra) per axis comparisons showed that supra speed in comparison to sub-threshold speed allowed for more accurate and faster response, regardless of axis and for rotation and translation experiments.  In particular, participants responded significantly faster during supra in comparison to sub for RO, PI in the rotational experiment.  The average RT for YA rotation and the translational axes also show that participants responded faster during supra than sub, however an effect without statistical significance due to the possible lack of data.

2) Speed stimuli (sub, supra) per response category comparisons across axes showed task difficulty with respect to axis.  Pitch, Roll, Yaw and UD, LR, FB were the least to most difficult rotational and translational axes tasks respectively; regardless of speed stimulation in a naturalistic environment.  Longer reaction times (>12s) corresponded with incorrect responses (NC) regardless of task difficulty, as correct responses (IC, EC) had significantly shorter reaction times than NC.  Longer reaction times corresponded with task difficulty, as longer reaction times were observed for yaw in comparison to roll and pitch (easier axes to detect motion).

3) Evaluating task difficulty or participant performance for both rotational and translational tasks, best performers achieved 76% accuracy and average performers achieved 51% accuracy.  The percentage remained the same when considering differences in speed (sup versus sub); thus participants adapted similarly when speed differences were present.  

4) Evaluating the distribution of participant performance with respect to rotation and translation stimuli, showed that there was a similar distribution of best, average, and worst performers regardless of rotational or translational stimuli.  Thus,  translational detection may not be more difficult than rotational detection in a realistic environment.

A comparison of ML model parameters 
-----------------
5) number of features : SD detection can be predicted from joystick data.  No significant difference were found in prediction accuracy when using all six joystick features, the top 3, 2, or 1 important features. Thus, building a model on a single important feature is sufficient to predict SD.  However, it is a best practice to use all relavant features for model construction.  

6) model type : Decision tree type models (DT, GBC, RF) were superior, to optimization based models (SGD, LDA, MLP, GNB, NuSVC), in test accuracy prediction regardless of the experiment (rot, trans), axis, speed, and semi-supervised label. Decision tree models are able to learn associations between the features and the label, regardless of semi-supervised label construction.  However, optimization based models predicted best when labels were constructed with respect to overall correctness via the lenient label. 

8) dataset conditions : Models using all of the data instead of a subset of the data, provided similarly accurate performing models. Therefore in order to predict SD in a specific circumstance, like roll, one can use data from any axis or speed context and SD will be accurately predicted for a specific context.

9) feature type : Three main findings were identified during feature importance investigation: 1) decision tree models perform best using extracted temporal information features, 2) optimization based model feature importance identified more temporal features as being important than constant natural frequency features, 3) semi-supervised labels did not influence feature importance for decision tree models however the strict label for optimization based models identified only temporal features as being important implying a lack of distinctive variety for non-SD data. 

10) semi-supervised label type : The decision to choose a strict or complex label convention where no mistakes are allowed in comparison to a lenient label where mistakes can be made, to discern SD depends on the application and the quantity of data available to represent a non-SD state. If very little data is present, less than , a lenient labeling convention is ideal in predicting SD.

The strict label is less realistically represenative of non-SD, because perfect behavioral data in any task is statistically rare, thus building an accurate model using a strict label convention maybe more challenging. Similarly, for the complex semi-supervised label there is lack of represntative data for each of the SD cases, overfitting (training predictions are higher than test predictions) is observed for both strict and complex labels supporting a lack of data for these labeling conventions.  

The lenient label, labeling with respect to overall correctness regardless if mistakes are made, was shown to be the best labeling convention as: 1) overfitting is not observed for our small dataset (test and training predictions are similar), 2) both natural frequency and temporal features are selected as important features thus a diversity of realistic patterns are captured, 3) both decision tree and optimization based models reasonably predict the test data.

Correlation of physical and perceptual disorientation
-----------------
11) One-third of participants felt physical disorientation during the task, however no significant relationship between physical disorientation and motion detection was found.  There was a trend where participants who initially detected unsuccessfully felt worst after the experiment than participants who did initially detected successfully or did not try.  More sample points regarding physical disorientation are needed during the experiment, instead of a sample before and after the task, in order to determine if physical disorientation is correlated with motion detection.
