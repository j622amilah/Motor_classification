LR, FB, UD had faster RT than RO, PI, and YA



Additionally, it is likely that more data is required for the optimization based algorithms to find relevant patterns within feature space with respect to the labels.  Implying that participant responses during SD and non-SD were similar with respect to amplitude.

Optimization based models could perform with higher prediction accuracy if more complex features were used that tried to exploite non-apparent temporal or spatial trends; creating features using PCA or nearest-neighbor clustering such as kmeans.   



People say :

Why roll and pitch detection is better than yaw : 
1) roll and pitch rotation stimulate the otolith organs, that information about rotation with respect to gravity, while yaw does not
2) Roll and pitch evoke a more pronounced stimulation of extravestibular sensory self-motion
information, such as proprioceptive cues, than yaw


      
-------------------------------
Summary of some Valko et al. 2012  results
-------------------------------

Vestibular dysfunction patients and controls had similar roll and LR detection, thus in roll and LR humans can accurately detect motion using only nonvestibular sensory cues (proprioception, tacile) or both vestibular and nonvestibular, more than in YA and UD.


For controls, UD and LR stimulation are similiarly detectable; there is no sensory advantage for UD detection due to gravity.  This is in alignment with studies that show that the vestibular nervous system normally compensates for gravity.  Specifically, there is an internal neural representation of gravity in the central nervous system that the brain uses for motor function. 

Authors believe that UD detection was more difficult than LR, for vestibular disfunction patients because they do not have a correctly developed internal neural representation of gravity and therefore have difficulties in dermining if forces are upward or downward
