4 Results

For both rotational and translational experiments, participant’s detection behavior was quantified with respect to stimulation speed and axis; no significant differences were for axial direction thus direction was not compared.  Rotational and translational experimental results were not directly compared for response profile analysis in subsection 4.1, because the body physiologically detects angular and linear motions differently.  However, for performance rank analysis in subsection 4.2, overall task difficulty for rotational and translational tasks are compared.

3.1 Response profile

Stimulus motion detection was quantified using the four response occurrence profiles and initial RT.  Figures 4 and 5 show the normalized summed count (top row), mean response occurrence count (middle row), and mean RT (bottom row) per response occurrence category, across participants for axes and speed conditions, for rotation and translation respectively.  The top row shows the normalized summed count per response category for each axis and speed condition. For rotation, the summed bars in the top row equal 648 which is the 18 participants multiplied by 36 trials; the top row represents the distribution of trial responses per response category.  Similarly for translation the summed bars in the top row equal 504 which is the 14 participants multiplied by 36 trials.  The middle row is a different visualization of the same normalized count data, except it displays the mean count.  The mean count represents the frequency of selecting a response category across participants.  Lastly, the bottom row displays the mean reaction time taken for each response category. Bars without error bars had a single sample value or several participants had the same count value.  Single sample bar values may exist due to the rigorous standardization process.

All 3 metrics (summed count, mean count, and mean RT) were compared for near sub-threshold and supra-threshold speed stimulations for roll, pitch, and yaw axes respectively; Wilcoxon signed rank test, and sum rank test were used to determine significance such that significant relationships were represented by (* within axis comparison of sub and sup, **: across axes comparison).  Bonferroni correction : p < 0.0167 was used as the significance threshold, p < 0.05 are mentioned as slight significant relationships.

All 3 metrics (summed count, mean count, and mean RT) were compared for near sub-threshold and supra-threshold speed stimulations for LR, FB, and UD axes respectively; Wilcoxon signed rank test, and sum rank test were used to determine significance such that significant relationships were represented by (* within axis comparison of sub and sup, **: across axes comparison).  Bonferroni correction : p < 0.0167 was used as the significance threshold, p < 0.05 are mentioned as slight significant relationships.


Response occurrence categories above the lower confidence interval, denoted by the red dashed line, were considered for statistical comparison across subjects of categories within (ie: sub versus sup) and across axis (ie: RO sub versus PI sub versus YA sub) conditions.


3.1.1 Detection: speed comparison (within axis condition)

For the rotational experiment some response occurrence categories had significantly lower RT for sup than sub speed condition. For Roll and Pitch axes, the RT for the most counted response occurrence category was significantly lower for sup stimuli in comparison to sub speed (RO RT EC sup vs. sub: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank: p < 0.000184, sumrank: p < 0.000977, n=66; PI RT IC  sup vs. sub: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank : p < 3.88e-07, sumrank : p <  0.000004, n=65).  Similarly, there was a slightly significant sub versus sup count difference for the most counted response occurrence category for Roll and Pitch axes, where sup speed resulted in a higher count than sub speed (RO count EC sup vs. sub: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank: p < 0.000244, sumrank: p < 0.026562, n=13; PI count IC sup vs. sub: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank: p < 0.081429 , sumrank: p < 0.201736, n=18).  There was a similar trend for the Yaw axis, where the most counted response occurrence category IC had higher sup count in comparison to sub count.  This demonstrates that participants were more accurate during sup speed than sub speed, regardless of the motion stimulation axis or direction.

No significance between sub and sup speeds were found for the translational experiment.  However, there was a trend for all axes where the most counted response occurrence category had higher sup count in comparison to sub count; refer to EC response occurrence category for LR and FB axes and IC response occurrence category for the UD axis.  Translational motion was less apparent than rotational motion, therefore we suspect that more data was needed in order for this trend to become statistically significance.

The fact that faster sup motion causes more accurate and faster motion detection than slower sub motion, is a result that has been reconfirmed in motion detection literature, thus confirming that the simulation experiment was performed correctly and the dataset accurately represents human response (citation). 




3.1.2 Detection : axes comparisons  (across axes per speed condition)
The same speed condition and response category were compared across axes, in order to identify difficulty of task with respect to axis.  Difficulty of the yaw task in comparison to the roll and pitch task, can be seen with the NR category count.  For yaw the count for NR category was higher than the 95% CI threshold, whereas for roll and pitch the count for NR was lower than the CI threshold or zero. Thus, for yaw, regardless of speed stimulation, a significant number of participants did not feel as if they were moving and thus did not respond.  In summary, yaw motion was the most difficult to detect of the 3 tasks, seen by the largest number of 	NR responses.  Thus, participants either detected initially correct yaw or did not detect any motion during fast motion.  And during slow motion, they either detected motion with difficulty (often making mistakes) or did not detect any motion.
Roll and Yaw EC count shows functional difference between roll and yaw tasks.  Considering slow motion and EC, roll EC sub count was significantly higher than yaw EC sub count (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.008057, sumrank:p < 0.000864, bartlett : p < 0.009853, n=13).  Similarly, considering fast motion and categories where initial mistakes were made, roll EC sup count was significantly higher than yaw EC sup count, (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000008 , sumrank:p < 0.000796, bartlett : p < 0, n=18). 
These results show that roll and yaw were both challenging for different reasons, in yaw participants either detected correctly (IC) or did not feel any motion (NR). Whereas in roll, participants could not initially detect the correct axis and/or direction, but they could eventually find the correct axis after several mistakes.
Pitch and Yaw IC count shows that participants were more precise during pitch.  Regardless of speed, there was a slight significance for pitch IC count being higher than yaw IC count (IC sub : Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.003357, sumrank:p < 0.017854, bartlett : p < 0.233839, n=16 ; IC sup : Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000107, sumrank:p < 0.030060, bartlett : p < 0.580689, n=18).  This implies that pitch was the least difficult task, and yaw was the most difficult task.
Task difficulty correlates with longer RT.  Roll EC NC responses were faster than yaw EC NC responses (NC sub RO YA : Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000005, sumrank:p < 0.008633, bartlett:p < 8.492329e-04, n=21 ; EC sub  RO YA : Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000147, sumrank:p < 0.003698, bartlett:p < 2.780069e-02, n=29).  This means that the roll task was easier to perceive motion than the yaw task, participants could perceive motion faster and thus responded faster for roll.  Simiarly to roll, the pitch task was easier to perceive motion than the yaw task.  Pitch IC sup responses were faster than yaw IC sup responses (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000200, sumrank:p < 0.000670, bartlett : p <.3.692384e-01, n=65).
A searching detection strategy, in comparison to a sensorial detection strategy, was used when participants were completely lost.  Roll NC sub responses were faster than pitch NC sub responses (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.000131, sumrank:p < 0.054280, bartlett : p < 1.659793e-01, n=21).  When participants had difficulty in sensing motion, participants responded faster during roll in comparison to pitch.  It is unlikely that participants could perceive roll better than pitch, because pitch had more perfect responses than roll, thus it is likely that participants stopped waiting to sensorially detect motion and started a searching strategy or felt false movement.   A searching strategy consists of self-generated motion by interacting with the perturbation stimulus to create additional motion cues about the correct stimulus orientation and/or direction.
Translational task difficulty : UD, LR, FB were the least to most difficult for the translational experiment.  In particular, FB EC sub count was significantly higher than UD EC sub count (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.007812, sumrank:p < 0.016145, bartlett : p < 0.740714, n=9).  This emphasizes the fact that participants made more initial mistakes for FB than UD, UD has more IC responses showing that participants made less mistakes. LR response behavior is similar to FB, where there are more counts for EC than any other category, however LR has a slightly larger count of IC than FB. 
LR NC sub responses were significantly faster than UD NC sub responses (Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.015625, sumrank:p < 0.00270, bartlett:p < 9.953192e-01, n=7).  This implies that participants were likely to use a searching strategy for LR than UD.  Since participants could detect UD better than LR, it is likely that participants stopped waiting to sensorially detect motion in LR and started a searching strategy or felt false movement.

3.2 Participant detection performance rank
Including both rotational and translational tasks, the highest rank score was 55 and the lowest score was 11.  On average, participants received a rank score of 37.  Therefore, the best performer, regardless of rotation or translation, achieved (55/72)*100=76.38% accuracy for the task.  And, the average performer was only able to achieve (37/72)*100=51.38% accuracy for the task.   The same task accuracy statistic was calculated for sub and supra conditions individually, for both rotation and translation separately, and similar results were found. Best performer accuracy : rot sub=(30/36)*100=83.33%, trans sub=(27/36)*100=75%, rot sup=(29/36)*100=80.5%, trans sup=(28/36)*100=77.7%.  Average performer accuracy : rot sub=(17/36)*100=47.2%, trans sub=(20/36)*100=55.5%, rot sup=(20/36)*100=55.5%, trans sup=(21/36)*100=58.3%.  Worst performer accuracy : rot sub=(5/36)*100=11.1%, trans sub=(0/36)*100=0%, rot sup=(11/36)*100=30.5%, trans sup=(9/36)*100=25%.  This shows that the detection task was challenging for the average person, regardless of the main speed condition (sub, supra) and the directional stimulation, however it was neither impossible to perform the task with reasonable success. 

The participant distribution count for the Rotational experiment was: 5 best performers, 11 average performers, 2 worst performers. And, similarly, the participant distribution count for the Translational task was: 2 best performers, 11 average performers, 1 worst performers.

Based on the fact that the participant distribution count for best, average, and worst performance are similar for the rotational and translational task, this shows that both tasks were similarly challenging in terms of motion detection.  Therefore, translational detection may not more difficult than rotational detection in a realistic environment, despite the fact that one might think that translation is more difficult because there is less gravity-driven inner-ear stimulation in translation than rotation



3.3 Classification: SD prediction
Classification accuracy, shown in Figure 6, was used to evaluate the predictive ability of each of the eight models; a value of 1 and 0 correspond to 100% and 0% perfect prediction.  These accuracy results not only directly tell us which models are superior than others for a compensatory tracking pilot task, they also indirectly tell us about the data.
Figure 6 shows that decision tree type models (DT, GBC, RF) were superior to optimization based models (SGD, LDA, MLP, GNB, NuSVC), regardless of the experiment type (rot, trans), axis, and speed.  Indirectly, this implies that important associations for SD prediction are not related to temporal or ordered information, because decision tree based models can not capture temporal patterns.   We performed analysis for both originally ordered features and reordered features with a gaussian distribution, accuracy results were similar for both analyses; gaussian distribution results are shown in Figure 6. Thus further demonstrating that temporal ordering of movements is not an indicator for SD but rather the amplitude value.  Additionally, it is likely that more data is required for the optimization based algorithms to find relevant patterns within feature space with respect to the labels.  Implying that participant responses during SD and non-SD were similar with respect to amplitude.
In comparing the three different semi-supervised labels, better accuracy can be obtained for optimization based models using a binary label in comparison to a multi-label (averaged lenient and strict versus complex:  Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, sumrank:p < 0.02, n=5).  In particular, the lenient label for the translational task produced higher accuracy for optimization based models (trans lenient versus complex: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, sumrank:p < 0.0143, n=5).  However, regardless of the labels, there was no difference in accuracy for the decision tree based models. Indirectly, regarding optimization based models, this again indicates that SD and non-SD responses were similar.  Labeling with respect to correctness, the lenient label, better separates data with respect to amplitude than labeling based on initial correctness.


Figure 6: Test data prediction accuracy for the eight models for different: experimental data subsections, semi-supervised label (strict, lenient, complex), and number of features used.  For visual ease, circles and crosses correspond to the rotation and translation experiment types, respectively.  Blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, magenta, and gray correspond to the SGD, LDA, RF, GBC, DT, MLP, GNB, and NuSVC models.  Regarding notation, ax0, ax1, ax2 indicate roll, pitch, yaw for the rotational task and LR, FB, UD for the translational task. Additionally, sup, sub, and all denote supra speed stimulation trials, sub speed stimulation trials, and all trials, respectively.
Finally, we investigated whether modeling a subset of the data, such as an experimental axis or speed condition, would result in better prediction of SD for that subset of data in comparison to using all of the data.  It is important to note that accuracy values for models, when all the data was used are a result of testing across all experimental conditions, thus it is an average performance score across experimental conditions.  We believed that average prediction across conditions was a sufficient representation of the model’s performance ability, to reduce the number of calculations we did not individually test all data models on subsets of axis or speed data to obtain precise accuracy prediction per condition.  We compared this average prediction score for models created from all data with average predictions of models created from only axis or speed data, across model type.  Significant differences were tested between all data model prediction scores and averaged axis or speed model predictions across model type, using a non-parametric distribution test.  No significant differences were found with regard to using all of the data in comparison to only speed or axis stimulus data, for decision tree models.  Optimization based models had 4 cases where there was a difference in accuracy with respect to the subset of data used.  Rotation axis data subset had higher accuracy for strict and complex than using all of the data (rot axis strict versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.008, n=8 ; rot axis complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.015, n=8).  There appears to be a predictive effect with using an initial correct label convention for separate axis data. Additionally, translational axis and speed data subset for the complex label had higher accuracy than using all of the data (trans speed complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.02, n=8 ; trans axis complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.05, n=8).  It is likely that using subset speed and axis data, instead of all of the data, helped to reduce variability such that distinguishing patterns could be found.






Figure 7: Test data prediction ROC AUC for the eight models for different experimental subsets of the data per semi-supervised label (strict, lenient, complex).  Circles and crosses correspond to the rotation and translation experiment types, respectively.  Blue, orange, green, red, purple, brown, magenta, and gray correspond to the SGD, LDA, RF, GBC, DT, MLP, GNB, and NuSVC models.  Regarding notation, ax0, ax1, ax2 indicate roll, pitch, yaw for the rotational task and LR, FB, UD for the translational task. Similarly, sup, sub, and all denote supra speed stimulation trials, sub speed stimulation trials, and all trials, respectively.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) measure, shown in Figure 7, was used to evaluate the model's predictive ability with respect to the label value, to evaluate whether the models could predict correctly regardless of the label value.  Figure 7 shows the same three main results as the accuracy results, indicating that the models are reliable in terms of identifying SD and non-SD data, and thus the accuracy value based on true positive and negative counts can be trusted.  The 3 summarized main results were: 1) decision tree type models (DT, GBC, RF) have almost perfect prediction and the majority of optimization based models (SGD, LDA, MLP, GNB, NuSVC) have above chance level predition regardless of the class label value (averaged lenient and strict versus complex:  Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, sumrank:p < 0.02, n=5). 2) Decision tree models predict well regardless of initial correctness or overall correctness label usage, however optimization based models predict best when labels are constructed with respect to overall correctness via the lenient label (trans lenient versus complex: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, sumrank:p < 0.027, n=5).  3) Models using all of the data instead of a subset of the data, provided similarly accurate performing models except for 4 cases.  Rotation axis data subset had higher accuracy for strict and complex compared with using all of the data (rot axis strict versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.05, n=8 ; rot axis complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov: nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.015, n=8).  Translational axis and speed data subset for the complex label had higher accuracy in comparison to using all of the data  (trans speed complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.02, n=8; trans axis complex versus all data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov : nonnormal distribution, signedrank:p < 0.05, n=8).



Figure 8: Feature order importance based on permutation importance, for each model.  Blue, orange and green circles indicate most important feature, second most important feature, and third most important feature.

Feature order importance allows for us to know which aspect of the joystick signal contains key information to detect spatial disorientation.  Figure 8 shows the feature importance for models where all the rotational or translational data was used.  Three main findings were identified: 1) decision tree models perform optimally using extracted temporal information features, 2) optimization based model feature importance identified more temporal features as being important than constant features, 3) semi-supervised labels did not influence feature importance for decision tree models however the strict label for optimization based models identified only temporal features as being important.

Extracted temporal information, such as the signal's natural frequency, that was transformed into a constant scalar feature greatly improved decision tree model prediction accuracy.  Regardless of the semi-supervised label type and experiment, decision tree models relied on natural frequency based features, more than position based features, to predict SD.  It is likely that these models found stronger patterns with natural frequency features because these feature values repeat per trial, instead of having a unique temporal trace like position based and the frequency response features. Decision tree model prediction accuracy was tested only using the four temporal features, and accuracy results were substantially less accurate at an average of 0.7 in comparison to 0.9 when the two natural frequency constant features were included.  Decision tree models are good at finding recurring/mode-like patterns between the features and the corresponding labels, whereas the optimization models are good at finding recurring patterns coupled with specific constraints such as causality.  In general, feature importance for decision tree models, from most to least important, were: 1) constant natural frequency of the joystick signal using a periodic estimation method, 2) constant natural frequency of the joystick signal using a frequency response method, and 3) the derivative of the joystick signal.  
Optimization based models where shown to be more sensitive to temporal features than the decision tree models, where more temporal features were identified to be more important than constant natural frequency features.  By average, feature importance for optimization based models, from most to least important, were: 1) constant natural frequency of the joystick signal using periodic estimation, 2) the derivative of the joystick signal, 3) the joystick signal.
Finally, considering the decision tree models, Figure 8 shows that regardless of the semi-supervised label the feature importance order remained the same, with freq_t and freq_fres being most important and second most important.  When evaluating the optimization models, feature importance order was similar for lenient and complex semi-supervised labels, with freq_t or freq_fres being the most important.  However, the first and second important features for the strict label contained more temporal features, such as joy and joy1derv, than natural frequency features.  In Figure 8, there are more blue and orange markers in the unboxed areas under joy and joy1derv for the strict label, than there are for the lenient and complex labels.  Indirectly, this implies that the trials that were identified as non-SD did not have distinctive information about the signal’s natural frequency, so no strong assocation was made for natual frequency features.  This also implies that there maybe too few data/examples that describe perfect initial response behavior or lack of distinctive variety of a non-SD event; even-though the classes were padded to have equivalent class representation. 

3.4 Perceived motion and physical disorientation
Twenty of the 31 total participants did not feel any difference in terms of physical disorientation over the entire experiment.  Considering, the performance rank score mentioned in 3.1, roughly1/3 of average detectors, 1/3 of best detectors, and 2/3 of worst detectors felt physical disorientation.  The 2/3 worst detection ratio is reported for completeness, however this measure is disregarded because it is based only on 3 participants.  Thus, 1/3 of the population regardless of performance felt physical disorientation.
To investigate whether there was a relationship between physical disorientation and detection performance, detection performance for the 12 participants who reported physical  disorientation was evaluated; see Table 3 for a percentage of their summed trial performance per category per SSQ difference report.  For instance, a participant who reported a 6 after the experiment and a 4 before the experiment would have their trial performance categories (ie : 8 trials were category 2, 6 trials were category 1, etc) associated with the SSQ score of -2.  Table 3 demonstrates that more negative physical disorientation was observed for unsuccessful initial detection response profiles (EC and NC) than for IC successful detection response or no response. The negative and positive SSQ disorientation differences per response category were summed respectively, to evaluate significance between IC negative and NC or EC negative.  Physically disoriented good performers (IC) do not report significantly less physical disorientation than poor performers (EC : p < 0.125 Wilcoxon signed rank, p < 0.248 Wilcoxon sumrank, NC :  p < 0.625 Wilcoxon signed rank, p < 0.563 Wilcoxon sumrank).



Table 3: Occurrence response category per reported SSQ disorientation subscale difference, for both rotational and translational experiments.  The bold negative SSQ values for categories EC and NC highlight that more negative physical disorientation was present for unsuccessful initial attempts to detect motion.

In summary, we report no significant relationship between physical disorientation and motion detection.  There is only a trend that EC and NC performers, that feel physical disorientation, felt better before the task than after.  Implying that participants became fatigued while trying to perform the task, when detection was not easy for them.  For IC performers, that feel physical disorientation, there was no trend in terms of feel better before or after.  Implying that participants who could detect easily, felt discomfort for other reason not related to the experiment.  There was a slight trend for NR performers, that feel physical disorientation, such that they felt better after the task than before.  Showing that participants who did not respond, became comfortable and relaxed in the dark experimental setting.
