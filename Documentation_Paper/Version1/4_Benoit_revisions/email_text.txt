I worked on the article. I realized reading again the instructions on the Human Factors page that "Authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplemental materials that would facilitate replication of the studies. Such materials would be available on-line at the journal's website. Examples include data, instructions, stimuli, algorithms, and questionnaires."

I have not seen that before. That is for us the way to keep the ms within the 4500 words limit. 

I have revised several sections in the articles, mostly intro-method. I started to work on the results section but stopped because I need to see the final results. Discussion is untouched yet for the same reason. Could you please:

- Finalize the results ASAP so I can work on the section, and decide with you what is in the main text, and what is in the Supp Mat (SM)
- Rework on this version, move to SM what can be moved
- This will give us a new number of words for the main text, and we’ll decide then if we have to move other stuff to SM.

What else can I do to speed up the process? We surely want the translation data to be included, but we cannot wait as discussed any longer to send that out for review. 
I’ll take the lead with the communication with other authors one we have a draft that you and I agree on.

Attached a recent paper with main text and Supplementary info to give you an idea of what can be in the main text, and what can be in the SM section. you probably will want to find other articles in the journal Human Factors .

Allez courage, we are moving forward

Best,

Benoit

Revisions 1

1) Title change

-> change from "Lost in translation and rotation: Quantification and prediction of spatial disorientation (SD) and motion control"

to

"Predicting spatial disorientation from motion control during near-threshold simulated flight."

- I do not mind changing the title, but this title only focuses on the motion control aspect of the experiment (after the participants found the correct axis and direction of stimulus movement).  In the experiment, participants did both detection and then control.

- In the paper, we use all the trial data for predicting general spatial disorientation (correct detection of the axis and direction is used to label whether the trial was considered 'disorientation' or 'not disorientation').  We include data from both sub and sup stimulation, and also acros all axes, so the SD prediction model is not made for sub and sup disorientation separately.  We can divide the data for sub and sup stimulation only, across all axes, and make two separate sub and sup stimulation SD disorientation models.  The downside would be that the models might be less reliable for prediction because each model is based on less data.  Would you like to do this?

And, then we use trial data from detection to the end of the trial to predict deadreckoning control ability (good or poor). 

Spatial disorientation can occur for both detection and control, so a more precise title might be :

1) Predicting spatial disorientation from motion control during simulated flight
2) Prediction of spatial disorientation (SD) and vestibular deadreckoning control during simulated flight
3) Quantification and prediction of spatial disorientation (SD) and vestibular deadreckoning control during simulated flight

Moved all tables and text, that was specified for the Supplementary Materials section, to Supplementary Materials.

Deleted 

"For both rotational and translational experiments, participants could move the joystick in six unique directions: right (roll right or translate right), left (roll left or translate left), forward (pitch forward or translate forward), backward (pitch backward or translate backward), counter-clockwise (yaw left or translate up), clockwise (yaw right or translate down).  Finally, the green line depicts the automatic re-positioning of the cabin in 10s; during events C and D the participant saw a red dot which indicated that s/he could rest."

You are correct, it is already said in the figure caption for figure 2.

Combine figure 2 and 3A
