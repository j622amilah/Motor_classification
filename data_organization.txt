Simulink saving (old method that Jeremie created, but it took a lot of processing time and thus caused delays in the system):

- For subjects 1 to 8
- Note: Jeremie sampled a data point every 0.1 seconds, so this dataset sampling rate is only 10Hz.  He downsampled because collecting all of the data would slow down the computer/Saturn too much.  Also, he figured that human response movement can not be faster than 10Hz, so he downsampled the data to this rate.
